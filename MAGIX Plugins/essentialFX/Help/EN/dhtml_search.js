The limit is displayed below the delay control (with deactivated &quot;tempo sync&quot;) as soon as it is reached, e.&nbsp;g. 46 ms (min).","BBD Compander: Here you can simulate Compander settings. Due to per-cell loss, BBDs have low system dynamics. For this reason, some have an integrated compander (compression at the input, counter-expansion at the output). Strong compander settings interact noticeably with the input signal, especially with high feedback, because the input effects the expansion ration at the output, even when there is no signal at the input.","BBD Clock Drift: This parameter can add drift (during audible jitter effects) by slightly varying the system beat of BBD cells.

Make the regular adjustments in the arrangement to route the sidechain signals.","Note: Sidechaining is not available in some host programs.","soft clip: Soft clip is switched on directly at the output in order to catch any overmodulations.","SC filter: This fader determines the application/middle frequencies, that are filtered with the control signal for level detection. The filter works selectively as a high-pass, band pass or low-pass. In many cases evaluating the detection is a good for optimizing the leveling process. So, for &nbsp;example &quot;high-pass&quot; filtering enables complex sources (drums or sum signals) to achieve consistent regulation without typical pumping artifacts, since the process is mainly activated via mids and highs. ","Using the filter type switch the properties of the detector circle can be drastically changed. The speaker symbol is there to preview changes. ","Threshold:  This sets the response threshold for regulation. For example, -20 dB indicates that the input/sidechain signal is only compressed once it reaches -20 dB; below this level, no change or hardly any change will take place. Note that this plug-in deals with the threshold window independent of the program. It can be the case that a small regularization has already taken place at -25dB. This so-called soft-knee characteristic ensures a soft, musical compression process.","Ratio:  This parameter regulates the compression ratio. For example&nbsp;, a value of 10:1 means that when the threshold level is reached, the input level is increased by 10dB, while the output is only 1dB louder. A lower compression, e.&nbsp;g. 2:1, is recommended for subtle compression of group or sum signals, while 50:1 produces a very hard limiting that cannot be made inaudible by even the most transparent compressor.","Attack &amp;  release: This parameter specifies how quickly the compressor responds when the threshold is reached (attack) or how quickly the signal applies normal amplitude once the signal drops below this level (release). The transient time settings can be defined in another area. Note that due to the adaptable plug-in leveling actual times may differ. This semi-automatic process favors quick adjustment, without leading to the often dreaded artifacts (rough sound image with rushed regulation, overly low/inefficient compression with long time constants).","Tweak ","Adaptive release: With increasing values, the compressor works increasingly with &quot;Adaptive release&quot;. This means that the longer and harder the compressor intercedes upstream in the signal path, the longer is the resulting release phase."," Auto makeup gain: Normally, you have to continuously adjust level reduction to generate &quot;compression&quot; at the same maximum level. This is done by activating auto makeup gain. The volume difference expected from the set working parameters is determined and applied as an output factor after master regulation. If you prefer to adjust the &quot;classic&quot; level reduction and amplification manually, you can deactivate this function.","Mix: Addition of the original signals is done to get transients and spectral balance form the source.

The second filter circuit (post-eq) is located behind the tube stage (or after the second) and determines the tonal balance of the output signal.","This enables you to create various sound nuances. For example, you can accentuate the high frequency range on the input side, for example, to create Exciter-/Enhancer effects, so that the signal appears more &quot;tangible&quot;. To avoid overemphasizing this amplified range, a reverse process with the post-EQ can be subsequently made.","Both of the available tube stages can be globally switched in the A or AB operation. In the A-circuit the entire signal runs through, as is common with simple tube preamps, through a tube. However, since these can only edit a half-wave, the working point of the circuit is set approximately in the middle of the reference line. However neither halve will ever be treated equally, so that positive displacements are amplified differently to negative displacements. (so-called Class A operation). Thereby odd and even harmonics are created. The typical 'warm' tube sound to a large extent dates back to the characteristic overtone spectrum.","For each half-wave in class-AB operation, a separate tube is used, so that in principle there is a symmetrical reinforcement.
